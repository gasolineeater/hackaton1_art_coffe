## Troubleshooting Common Windows Issues

### Node.js Path Issues
If you encounter "node not recognized as an internal or external command":
1. Open System Properties (Right-click on This PC > Properties > Advanced system settings)
2. Click on Environment Variables
3. Under System variables, find and select PATH, then click Edit
4. Click New and add the path to your Node.js installation (typically C:\Program Files\nodejs\)
5. Click OK on all dialogs
6. Restart Command Prompt

### Port Already in Use
If port 5173 is already in use:
1. Either close the application using that port
2. Or modify the port in the Vite configuration:
   - Open `vite.config.ts`
   - Add a server section:
     ```typescript
     export default defineConfig({
       plugins: [react()],
       server: {
         port: 3000 // or any other available port
       }
     })
     ```

### Long Path Issues
Windows has path length limitations. If you encounter issues:
1. Enable long paths in Git:
   ```
   git config --system core.longpaths true
   ```
2. Enable long paths in Windows (requires admin rights):
   - Open Registry Editor (regedit)
   - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem`
   - Set `LongPathsEnabled` to `1`
   - Restart your computer
